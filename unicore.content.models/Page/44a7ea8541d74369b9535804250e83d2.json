I was on my way home from an errand one evening and I was just a few blocks from my house. Up ahead I could see a group of three teenage boys on the corner outside a bar. I knew they were trouble. I didn\u2019t slow down. I didn\u2019t want them to know I was scared. It was too late to turn around. So what I did was cross the street to avoid them. But they were watching me and waiting for me. They crossed the street and started to follow me. My heart was pounding. ",
