        "content": "*Girls all around the world usually get their period between 12 - 14 years old, but they can start earlier or later. Getting your period can be surprising or scary. This is one girl\u2019s story.*\r\n\r\nMy name is Deepa. I am 13 and live in India. I got my period last month. When I saw the blood in my underwear I was surprised, but not scared because my mom told me that I would start my period some time after I turned 12. \r\n\r\nI washed out my underwear and told my mom what happened. She was so happy that her daughter had become a woman! She gave me a pack of sanitary pads and showed me how to put one in my underwear. It was a new experience for me but I did OK through the rest of the week.\r\n\r\nThen, a month later I was at school. It began as a normal day until I started to feel funny in my stomach. It felt like I had cramps. I thought I was getting sick and didn\u2019t know it was a sign that I was getting my period. My period came that day and I was not ready.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I had to leave school because I got blood on my skirt and on my seat. I thought everyone must have seen it. I was so embarrassed. I did not want to go back to school ever again.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home my mom sat me down and said that this same thing happened to my sister.  She said we can make sure it won\u2019t happen again because I can track my period and know when it was going to come next month, because my period comes about every 28 days. \r\n\r\nShe said, \u201cYou count the first day that you bleed as Day 1. You will probably have 5 days of bleeding.  If you keep a count of the days you will know when it is due\u2026 which is on Day 28. Then you start again and count the first day of your bleeding as Day 1. For most women the menstrual cycle is between 21 to 35 days. We\u2019ll mark it on your calendar.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went back to school the next day and nobody said a word about it. No one seemed to notice or care.  It was a hard lesson to learn for me, but I am so thankful for my mom, for the calendar and for the information.\r\n\r\n**HAVE YOU STARTED MENSTRUATING?  HERE ARE SOME FACTS:**\r\n\r\n - Every month your ovaries release an egg, and the lining of your uterus (womb) thickens to get ready in case that egg gets fertilized (in other words, when you get pregnant). If the egg is not fertilized that month, this thick lining breaks down and come out over a few days \u2014that\u2019s your period. \r\n - Once you start menstruation your body is able become pregnant and have a baby if you have sex. You must make sure you protect yourself from getting pregnant if you are not ready to have a baby.\r\n - It is normal to have some cramps in the stomach during menstruation. It helps to place a warm water bag on your stomach. It is better to do light exercise like walking around than to stay in one place. If the pain is too much, please consult a doctor. \r\n - If sanitary napkins are not available and you use a cloth, make sure that the cloth is soft, cleaned and dried properly.\r\n - When you do not get your period, your body is sending you a message, so pay attention. Try to eat healthy foods and get lots of sleep. If you don\u2019t get your period for a few months, you should go see a nurse or a doctor. \r\n",
